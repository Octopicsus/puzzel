# Mondrian Art Project
This project is a digital representation of Piet Mondrian's art, created using modern web technologies—HTML and CSS. It demonstrates how simple HTML elements combined with CSS can be utilized to produce dynamic, visually striking designs that echo the iconic abstract style of Mondrian.

## Overview
The project recreates Mondrian’s distinct geometric compositions using a structured HTML layout and carefully styled CSS. By leveraging standard web technologies, we can transform a traditional web page into a piece of art.

## Key Technologies:
HTML: Provides the structure of the digital artwork.
CSS: Adds color, spacing, and animations to bring the artwork to life.
Core HTML Elements:
This project heavily relies on the following HTML tags to build the grid layout, which is characteristic of Mondrian's style:

<table>: 
The table element is the foundation of the layout, organizing the structure into rows and columns.

<tr>: 
Each row in the table represents a distinct horizontal slice of the artwork.

<td>: 
Table cells hold individual blocks of color, acting as the "building blocks" of the composition.

### Important Attributes:
To capture the unique arrangement and proportions seen in Mondrian’s art, we make extensive use of two important table attributes:

colspan: 
This attribute allows a single cell to span across multiple columns. It is crucial for creating larger blocks of color that extend horizontally across the grid.

rowspan: 
This attribute enables a cell to stretch vertically across multiple rows, ensuring that certain blocks maintain their characteristic size and shape.
Together, these attributes allow the table layout to break out of the typical grid pattern, mirroring the unpredictable and asymmetric balance of Mondrian’s compositions.

## Visual Style:
Through CSS, each cell in the table is styled to reflect the vibrant, bold colors Mondrian is known for—red, blue, yellow, black, and white. CSS animations add subtle effects to the design, enhancing the visual appeal with transitions and dynamic color changes, particularly in the red blocks, which feature gradient animations.

## How to View the Project:
Open the HTML file in any modern web browser.
The styling and layout will automatically render, displaying the digital artwork inspired by Mondrian.

This version highlights how HTML and CSS can be used to create digital art in the Mondrian style, with emphasis on the functionality of key table-related elements and attributes.
